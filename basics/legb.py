# When using a name in a function and Python needs to determine its value,
# Python looks up the name using the LEGB rule: It first looks in the local scope,
# then, from inside out, all enclosing functions' scopes,
# then the global scope, and finally the built-in scope.
# If a variable is not found in any scope, a NameError is raised.
